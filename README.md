# Starting to Note Down my Journey on Blockchain & Crypto

## Resources

- Coin Bureau Podcast
- Blockchain Coursera Course [Buffalo](https://www.coursera.org/learn/blockchain-basics/home)
- Ethereum and Solidity Udemy
### Coursera

- Every try to "do something" on blockchain has failed
  - doesn't need block chain
- Try to look at things from a different point of view
  - economics, tokenization
- UTXO, Unspent Transaction Output
- Three types of blockchain
    1. Only Cryptocurrency, e.g. Bitcoin
    2. Currency + Business Logic, e.g. Ethereum
    3. Only Business Logic, e.g. Linux's hyperledger
- Three categories of blockchain
    1. Public, e.g. Bitcoin
    2. Private
    3. Permissioned
- ommer blocks in ethereum
- symmetric key encryption
    - e.g. ceasar code
    - easy to decrypt
    - hard to pass
- asymmetric key pair x/X
    - x encrypt => X decrypt
    - X excrypt => x decrypt
    - let's say there is John x/X, Jean y/Y
        - John sends to Jean by x/Y encrypt
        - Jean decrypt by X/y
        - no 3rd party can decrypt
- Merkel hash
