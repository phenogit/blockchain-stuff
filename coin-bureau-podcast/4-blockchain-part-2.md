- nodes and miners
    - nodes
        - store
        - validate
        - enforce rules
- transaction broadcasts to all nodes
    - check if values are available
        - ok => pending state
    - transaction is grouped into blocks
    - miners then come into play
        - secure
        - confirm transaction
            - concensus => >51% agreeing the state is correct and ok to add to chain
                - proof of work => 投票的問題，需要 skin in the game
                    - work: block is hashed
                    - hash: 
                        - hypersensitive to input data
                        - producing/verifying is cheap
                        - hash of a transaction is added to another transaction, so on and so forth
                            - the OG => root hash => any change will mess the root hash up
                            - this is arranged in a "Merkel" Tree(1979)
                                - leaves are all transactions, parents are hashed
                    - linking of the blocks
                        - block header: tldr of block
                            - version of software
                            - timestamp
                            - root hash
                            - preceding block's hash
                            - target
                            - nonce
                                - miner use nonce + everything else to find a result lower than target
                                    - hash(nonce + xxx) < target
                                - this is the proof of work
                                - achieve and get a block reward(currently 6.25, halved every 4 years or so)
                                    - bitcoin halving
                            - increasing difficulty
                                - we want 10 min blocks to be stable
                                - GPU OG, Lazlo, 10,000 BTC for two pizzas
                                    - ASICs => 挖礦機
                - proof of stake
        - distribute fairly
    - miners are nodes, nodes are not all miners
        - miners are usually the minority
