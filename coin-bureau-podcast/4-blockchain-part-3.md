- rewards
    - every transaction
    - block reward for mining
- blockchain
    - database stored on every node
- node
    - computer that is running the specific blockchain software
- PKI, public key infrastructure
    - user has two keys
        - public key => basically the address
        - private key => used to sign transaction
    - A send bitcoin to B
        - B needs A's public key
        - B needs to sign the transaction with B's private key
        - A doesn't need anything
    - similar to banking => not 100% correct, but close enough
        - Public key is like the bank account => freely give out
        - Private key is like your PIN
    - Actually public key is not the address, but derived from the public key
        - elliptic curve signature ECDSA => almost impossible to reverse engineer
- Transaction is broadcast to all nodes
    - transactions form blocks, blocks form chain
    - consensus to confirm all transactions in block is valid => 51% agree
    - changes to previous block will break everything after
        - nickname "truth machine"
        - in fact, much more transparent and easier to track than cash
- Why don't we just run a bunch of nodes and takeover?
    - theoritically possible
    - carrot and stick
        - proof of work to win a "lottery"
            - started from preventing spam mail
        - reward will be useless when corrupted
    - Government & terrorist & crazy people
- Blockchain Trilemma - satisfy all three?
    - Decentralize
    - Security
    - Speed
        - BTC: 7 transaction per second, TPS
        - Visa: 65k transaction per second, TPS
- Proof of Stake
    - Proof of Work drawback
        - energy
        - speed
        - high barrier of entry
    - Staking crypto to be chosen to mine(validator), e.g. buying a lottery ticket
        - misbehaving validator will be slashed
