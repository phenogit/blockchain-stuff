    - 4 types

            - simple
            - bank liability transfer
        - different bank payment, e.g. bank A & bank B

                - Heat, great movie
                - two methods to address this
                    - corresponding bank account
                        - every bank needs a funded account for every other bank
                            - hard to maintain, fund lock up
                            - still exists, but not as common
                    - central bank account
                        - all banks have an account with the central bank account
                        - two ways to track
                            - deferred net settlement(pretty much defunct)
                                - tally up in/out for a day, settled at the end of the day with a single payment
                                - suicide Tuesday => weekend tally, Monday you see you are broke...
                            - real time gross settlement
                                - bank needs more in the central bank account
                        - not all banks have accounts with central
                            - clearing banks => act as central for smaller banks
        - cross border payment
            - same currency
                - corresponding bank account
                - subsidiary bank

                - corresponding bank account with correct currency
        - foreign exchange payment
            - corresponding bank
            - money transfer operator
