- Transact digitally without middle man
- The technology that enables crypto
- problems
    - double spend
    - locked accounts => wikileaks
- need a method to keep people honest
- What is blockchain? Decentralized & Immutable
    - basically a database that is stored at multiple nodes
        - nodes => computers running the specific blockchain's software
            - contains full transaction history => also known as distributed ledger
    - block: a group of transaction records
    - chain: chain of blocks
    - consensus: when majority of nodes agree that a block is valid and can be added to the chain
        - 51% attack
            - note, if it happens, the 49% is able to detect, and the value is destroyed
            - possible risk => anarchist, government?!
                - China => US/Central Asia
    - immutable
- bitcoin: design incentive and tradeoff
    - miners: validate chain & get rewarded => block reward
        - think of it like a lottery => paid for in computing power
            => proof of work
        - currently for bitcoin: every 10 mins a block is created => 6.25 bitcoin
